My home  

My home sweet home  

I miss the sand between my toes as I walk next to the ocean.  

Or the sound of waves clashing against each other in a rapid motion.  

I miss the sun.  

And its bright smile as it radiates against my skin while I am having fun.  

The smell of the sea brings back memories.  

My Home  

Oh, How I miss my home sweet home.
