I still hate this assignment  



I still do not like this assignment.  

How many times are we doing this assignment?  

On a completely unrelated note, how many days of school are we allowed to miss without getting into trouble?  

I do not enjoy presenting my work.  

It’s similar to someone reading your diary.  

But I guess that’s a stupid analogy because I’m far too lazy to keep a diary.  

You have to write in them every day.  

And I don’t even have the discipline to make sure I eat a vegetable every day.  

Like, hey mom! I ate a baby carrot! Look at me being all healthy.  

So, if I did magically acquire the ability to stay consistent  

And then decided that, out of all things I could be doing with my newfound thing called. “Self-control”  

That I was going to start writing in a book every day.   

That would be one boring book.  

Hello. Today I had pizza at lunch. And my teacher made us present another poem… and I didn’t like it…  

Hello again. This week I fell down the stairs because I didn’t want to step on my dog.  

Hello. Today is… Thursday… the thirteenth. Send help we have to do the public speaking again.  

*fancy bow*
