Sometimes it seems like the human being is made of glass.  

Every single one of us seems so fragile.  

One hurtful word or phrase can break this “perfect” glass.  

However, this glass, this fragile broken glass, can be put back together.  

Though the crack in the glass will always stay.  

Leaving behind a terrible memory.  

Feelings get hurt and people change, and this can all occur from a simple mistake.  

Though I wouldn’t view a mistake as a negative or a positive thing.  

I believe it’s a learning opportunity.  

No human is perfect, we all have a crack or two in our so called “perfect” glass we have made.
