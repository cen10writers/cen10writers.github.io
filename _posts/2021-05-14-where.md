“Absolutely nowhere”  



Or at least that’s just what I say, when I get asked, “Where are you going?”   



Because I still don’t know  



And if I don’t know then what gives someone else a right to know?  



And what gives them the right to ask?  



What if I decide that I’m not going anywhere  



What would they say then?  



They would ask me, “Why didn’t you go” or “Where would you have gone.’  



But no  



I still have no idea where I’m going  



Still undecided, undeclared  



Feeling unprepared  



Getting ready for the next time someone asks me, “Where are you going.”
