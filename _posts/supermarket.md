I wonder who I’ll see?  
What am I making for dinner?  
We can just go somewhere but  
We’ve gone somewhere for the past two weeks  
And I’ve spent hecka money  
  
  
I don’t remember the last meal I cooked  
Maybe it was the Korean bowls I took the Watson’s  
Because they had a new baby  
And when you have a new baby  
In America  
Apparently,  
It’s customary to stop cooking for at least a month  
Your husband or boyfriend can’t cook either,  
Apparently, they forget how so others step in  
Even single dads  
With four kids  
Who are selling a home while looking for one to buy  
In a market where California transplants are buying everything up   
With their San Francisco money  
  
  
I wonder who I’ll see,  
What can Phina eat  
That’s gluten free  
And dairy free  
And yet still tasty  
And won’t make her feel left out  
  
  
At least she doesn’t have Celiac Disease  
Like Judah, the family friend who 
will never have Panda Express  
See to him, even a pinprick of gluten means death,  
it’s like fentanyl, instant death  
Causing his stomach to cannibalize itself,  
it’s like Kryptonite,  
It’s like driving blind  
It’s like wanting to stay awake while eating sleeping pills  
It’s like...anyways.  
  
  
Maybe she can have a little,  
Of gluten and dairy  
Just a smidge  
Un poquito  
Like my dad says, “What do you mean she can’t have milk?  She can’t have milk?  At all?”  
But he doesn’t understand,  
Allergies are myths to him  
They are not real  
And as much as I can quote sources and medical journals  
And say, “Dad, her doctor says she can’t have gluten or milk  
He is still like, “Really, not even a little bit?”  
And for your information, my dad does not visit the doctor ever.  
  
  
I wonder who I’ll see.  
All I can think of are dinners with gluten  
But I know that even a little will bloat her stomach  
And that’s not a good look  
To look puffy and cute but still puffy in the tummy.  
  
  
So I drive to Chik-Fil-A  
And wait in the drive thru with all of Boise and Meridian  
Again, on a Friday night.
