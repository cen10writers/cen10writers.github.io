My uncle  

My one and only uncle  

I'll never hear your voice or feel your hug,  

Listen to your heartbeat or make you laugh  

But I always have you in my thoughts  

My one and only uncle   

one and only  

one and only like a snowflake  

delicate snowflakes that are said to all be   

different and unique to themselves  

but how are we to check every snowflake to see the difference?  

And learn every in of the snowflake  

We can only assume theyâ€™re different  

Assuming how humans assume  

Consuming how humans consume  

Like feeling the feelings then denying feeling those feelings  

And feeling ashamed for feeling those feelings that you deny feeling  

So why do we say that all snowflakes are different  

And not that all snowflakes are similar  

Connected by the traits they share  

But unique by which the ones they differ
