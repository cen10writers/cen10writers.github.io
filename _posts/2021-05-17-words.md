Writing saved me from the tree.  

Writing spoke out about all the people who hurt me.  

Writing is something that can never scare me.  

Or erase me.   


The words I write can never keep me from being me.   

The words I write make others happy.  

The words I write have fed me.  

And sometimes I write those words unhappily
