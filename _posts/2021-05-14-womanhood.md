I’ve heard women in older generations talk about modesty  

Like a grand philosophy, a high class society ideology  

Deciding with one look a woman’s worth  

Little girls with eyes the size of suns listen to every word  



I’ve seen mother’s live the life they never got through their bright daughters  

I’ve seen beauty exploited until it’s unrecognizable  

I’ve felt the lines of my ego and idea of self-worth blur until I can’t tell them apart  



Womanhood is realizing you aren’t a kid anymore  

It’s applying lipstick in dirty mirrors  

It’s a stomachache that wakes you from your sleep  

Womanhood is the dark side of the moon,  

And the fabric of the air we breathe
