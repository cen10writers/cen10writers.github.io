This planet  

This little blue spec is the soul of our life’s  

Every war  

Culture  

Idea  

Is made on this tiny blue spec in the infinite universe  

When was the last time you admired the clouds?  

Felt the grass between your toes? Not those plastic sole shoes you wear  

Skin to earth.  

What it used to be  

Relax your jaw  

Let your belly hang out  

Breathe in her air like it’s the last breath you’ll ever take  

Feel her presence  

Feel her pain  

Her sky starts to cry as you cut down her trees  

Washing what was once your trash into her creeks  

Into her rivers  

Into her ocean  

feed the fish, right?  

That’s what you laughed as you through your cup out the window  

Feed your mind dude  

80% of oxygen in our entire atmosphere comes from that ocean   

She provides that water you drink, that food you eat, that crisp air you take advantage of every single day  

Yet there are clouds of carbon smog coming from factories like a demon’s breath  

Feel her presence  

Feel her pain
