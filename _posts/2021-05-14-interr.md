Where are the experiences?  

I sometimes mention those “that one time…” and “what ifs.”  

Trying to fit in  

But I barely fit the mold that I put before me  



I speak out and no one responds  

Because I never spoke at all  

I think I’m yelling but  

It’s a mere whisper  

My friends carry on so casually  

They shake hands with the soil we walk on  

but I crumble with each step   



My mouth is glued shut  

And I’d pull and pull and pull  

The more I’d pull the stickier it’d get   

Just say something, say anything  

But all I can do is cough up the glue and cluttered phrases  



I’m walking on this path aligned with green trees in front of a blazing sky  

Then there’s this roadblock faultlessly set in my way  

So I’ll put my hands together and look down at my shoes  

And just wonder who’d put this here   

And the answer is in the mirror  

This room I’m in feels like the walls are coming closer and closer  

And the key to get out is under this mat but  

My foot just won’t let up  



Every birthday I’d sit at the same vanilla cake and wish for one thing  

To be able to speak my mind without my mind stopping me  

And the sparks on the cake fly tiredly from telling me to just stop trying  



I sit and watch my life play out before me  

I follow my physical body like a ghost  

Just watching, just waiting  

You haven’t gotten what you want  

And you’re scared to
