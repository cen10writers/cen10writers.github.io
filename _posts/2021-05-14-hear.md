I need to hear the loud sound of the motor starting  

Struggling to put the yellow suit on my sore limbs from the previous heat  

While placing a white helmet on my head  

I need to hear the boys laughing at me  

“You can’t do it” they say  

It fuels me  

I hover above the water and it drowns out the sound   

My mind floods in remembering the words of other people’s low expectations  

They don’t know who I am, they don’t what I’m capable of  

My heartbeat races faster than ever as I line up for the start  

3…2…1…  

The green flag drops  

I need to hear myself scream at the boat  

I let of the throttle, squeeze the steering wheel, and I rotate my arms   

I come around turn two and the white flag waves so brilliantly in the wind  

One more lap around and I come upon the finish line  

Things are different this time  

People are astonished  

I win the race!
